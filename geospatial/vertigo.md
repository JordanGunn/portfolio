# Vertigo: Advanced LiDAR Vertical Accuracy Assessment Platform

## Project Overview

Designed and developed **Vertigo**, a specialized Python framework for vertical accuracy assessment of LiDAR data according to ASPRS (American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) standards. This tool enables precise validation of elevation data quality through statistical analysis of ground control points against LiDAR-derived elevation models.

    - Vegetated Vertical Accuracy (VVA) testing with 95th percentile methods
    - Quantile-based accuracy metrics for non-normal distributions
    - Outlier detection and robust statistical methods

2. **Ground Control Point (GCP) Processing**
    - Coordinate reference system transformations
    - Spatial indexing for efficient point cloud querying
    - Nearest neighbor search algorithms for point matching
