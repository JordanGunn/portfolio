## Project Overview

LIQCS (LiDAR Quality Control System) represents one of my earliest and most impactful contributions to the 
geospatial community. Developed for GeoBC (the geographic information division of the Province of British 
Columbia), this comprehensive quality control tool has become the standard platform for validating LiDAR 
deliverables against the province's strict technical specifications.

This project launched my career as a geospatial developer and continues to serve as the primary QA/QC 
pipeline for British Columbia's provincial LiDAR acquisitions today.

## Technical Architecture

The LIQCS system implements a modular architecture focused on comprehensive validation of LiDAR data products:
