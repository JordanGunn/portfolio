## Technical Achievements

### 1. Revolutionary Kubernetes Debugging Infrastructure

**The Industry Problem:**
Most organizations accept a fundamentally broken development workflow in cloud-native environments—the painful cycle of code-push-wait-check that can take 15-20 minutes per debugging iteration. This problem is so pervasive that even major tech companies simply accept it as inevitable.

**The Innovation:**
Pioneered a **dual-mode container system** that seamlessly switches between production and debug configurations, enabling real-time debugging of Go applications running in Kubernetes clusters.

**Technical Implementation:**
```dockerfile
# Production-optimized build with debug symbols
RUN go build -a -o main -installsuffix cgo -gcflags="all=-N -l" ${BUILD_TGT}

# Multi-stage build with dedicated debug runtime
FROM gadev.azurecr.io/geoanalytics/debug/delve:1.24.1
COPY --from=application "/app/main" "./main"
ENTRYPOINT ["./entrypoint.debug.sh"]
```


**Environment-Aware Helm Templates:**
```yaml
{{- if ne .Values.env "prod" }}
command: ["dlv"]
args: ["--headless=true", "--listen=:40000", "--api-version=2"]
{{- else }}
command: ["./main"]
{{- end }}
```


**Key Innovations:**
- **Environment-conditional debugging** preventing production exposure
- **Multi-client support** enabling team debugging sessions
- **IDE integration** through standard Delve protocol
- **Security-first design** with non-root execution

### 2. Sophisticated Reverse Proxy Architecture

**Challenge:**
Each IDE (RStudio, VSCode, JupyterLab) requires different networking protocols, headers, and routing configurations. Traditional reverse proxies fail to handle the complexity of modern web-based development environments.

**Solution:**
Built a **composition-based architecture** using Go's type system to create specialized IDE clients that share common Kubernetes service discovery while implementing protocol-specific routing logic.

**Technical Highlights:**

**Dynamic Service Discovery:**
```go
func (c *client) GetAddressHTTP(user string, project string) (string, error) {
    svc, err := c.GetService(user, project)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    
    ip := c.serviceIP(svc)
    portNum := c.servicePortNumber(svc)
    return fmt.Sprintf("http://%s:%d", ip, portNum), nil
}
```


**WebSocket-Aware Proxying:**
```go
func (vc *VSCodeClient) director(req *http.Request) {
    hdr := req.Header
    
    // Detect WebSocket upgrade requests for VSCode LSP
    if strings.Contains(hdr.Get("Connection"), "Upgrade") && 
       strings.Contains(hdr.Get("Upgrade"), "websocket") {
        hdr.Set("Connection", "Upgrade")
        hdr.Set("Upgrade", "websocket")
    }
    
    hdr.Set("X-Forwarded-Prefix", rootPath)
}
```


**IDE-Specific Optimizations:**
- **RStudio:** Custom `X-RStudio-Root-Path` header injection for RServer compatibility
- **VSCode:** Advanced WebSocket handling for Language Server Protocol support
- **JupyterLab:** Notebook kernel proxy management with dynamic path prefixes

### 3. Clean Architecture Transformation

**Inherited Challenge:**
Received a codebase with severe architectural problems—massive code duplication (6000+ lines), poor separation of concerns, and maintenance nightmares where bug fixes required changes across multiple 2000+ line files.

**Architectural Solution:**
Completely refactored the system using clean architecture principles, reducing the codebase by 90% while eliminating all duplication and improving maintainability.

**Key Improvements:**

**Type-Safe Architecture:**
```go
// Clean type system with semantic aliases
type (
    ideResource     = gatypes.IdeResource
    resourcePayload = gatypes.ResourcePayload
    chanResource    = chan resourcePayload
)
```


**Dependency Injection Pattern:**
```go
func NewRStudioController(ctrl *Controller, payload resourcePayload) *RStudioController {
    return &RStudioController{
        resourceName: fmt.Sprintf("%s-%s", username, typeRStudio),
        Payload:      &payload,
        logger:       ctrl.Logger,
        k8sClient:    ctrl.K8sClient,
        db:           &ctrl.Db,
    }
}
```


**Configuration Management:**
```go
func init() {
    // Fail-fast validation of required configuration
    if resourceGroup == "" {
        panic(env.AzureResourceGroup + " not configured")
    }
}
```
