# Overview

A repository outlining journaling details of projects and career highlights.

This repository is not an exhaustive list of my work, but rather, learning moments, milestones, or work that has sentimental value. 
All documents outline design, architecture, and implementation details, as well as personal reflections and anecdotes.
