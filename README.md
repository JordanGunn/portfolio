# Overview

A repository outlining journaling details of projects and career highlights.

This repository is not an exhaustive list of my work, but rather, learning moments, milestones, or work that has sentimental value. 
All documents outline design, architecture, and implementation details, as well as personal reflections and anecdotes.

## `gijo/` (2018)
This directory contains all documentation, personal notes, diagrams, and implementation details of the `gijo` chat protocol and client/server application.
 
GiJo represents a pivotal moment in my technical journeyâ€”a C-based networking application that sparked my passion for software architecture and system design. 
Originally developed as a school project, its design principles and implementation of low-level networking concepts demonstrate stand the test of time with 
regards to programming capabilities and architectural thinking. 

This project implements a custom-designed chat protocol using the Berkeley Sockets API, enabling reliable 
communication between networked clients while demonstrating advanced of concurrent programming principles and network protocol design.

The architecture embodies several key design principles:
1. Separation of Concerns: Clear boundaries between networking, protocol implementation, and application logic
2. Modularity: Self-contained components with well-defined interfaces
3. Protocol Simplicity: A carefully designed messaging system that handles only what's necessary
4. Resource Efficiency: Careful memory management and performance considerations
5. Polymorphism in C: Advanced object-oriented patterns implemented in pure C
6. Dual-Protocol Support: TCP for reliable messaging and UDP for real-time voice


## `infrastructure/`
- [Revival of cloud-infrastructure deployments for full idempotent automation using bicep IaC for Azure](infrastructure/bicep.md)
- [Designing templated manifest configurations for dynamic deployment of multi-environment systems via CI/CD integration.](infrastructure/deployments.md)
- [Configuring a remote debugger for kubernetes deployed applications with CI/CD integration for development environments.](infrastructure/k8s-debugging.md)
